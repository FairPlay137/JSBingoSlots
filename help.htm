		<h2 style="text-align:center;">Slingo - Game Play:</h2>
		<p>The object of Slingo is to accumulate the highest number of points by covering all the numbers.  A game ends when the card is filled or after 20 spins.</p>
		<p>At the start of a Slingo game you are given a card with 25 numbers (five columns of five numbers).  Under the card are five wheels corresponding to each of the five columns of numbers.  Each spin generates a unique set of numbers and game icons in the five wheels.</p>
		<p>On each spin, you match your numbers and Jokers appearing in the wheels by clicking on a number in the corresponding column above.  A correct match covers the number.  The wheels also display game icons (<font color="red">Gold Coin</font>, <font color="red">Free Spin</font>, and the <font color="red">Devil</font>).</p>
		<p>When the TAKE SPIN button flashes, you have 10 seconds to take your spin.  If you don't take your spin within the 10 seconds, you lose that spin. You must complete a spin in a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>
		<p>During spins 17-20 you must buy each spin using your points or an accumulated Free Spin.  If you do not have enough points or Free Spins to use, the game will end.</p>
		<h3>SCORING:</h3>
		<p>Each <font color="red">Covered Number</font> earns 200 points.</p>
		<p>A <font color="red">Joker</font> allows you to click on only one uncovered number in the corresponding column above that Joker.  Each number covered using a Joker earns 200 points.</p>
		<p>A <font color="red">Gold Coin</font> awards 1000 points to your score.</p>
		<p>A <font color="red">Devil</font> deducts one-half of the points from your score.  After the Devil takes your points you can still continue to earn points and/or Free Spins.</p>
		<p>The <font color="red">Cherub</font> randomly appears to chase the Devil before he has an opportunity to take half your points. Remember, when the Cherub appears your points are protected only for that spin.</p>
		<p>A <font color="red">Free Spin</font> is automatically saved for use during spins 17 - 20 to buy a spin.  You can accumulate a maximum of four Free Spins in a game.</p>
		<p>A <font color="red">Slingo</font> occurs when five successive numbers are covered either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It is possible to get multiple Slingos during any spin. There are 12 possible Slingos, and each Slingo earns 1,000 points.</p>
		<p><s>A <font color="red">Joker Bonus</font> occurs when three or more Jokers appear on the wheels.</s> <b>(this version does not have Joker Bonuses yet)</b></p>
		<p><s>A <font color="red">Super Joker</font> allows you to click on only one uncovered number in any column, even if it doesn't have a Joker.  Each number covered using a Super Joker earns 200 points.</s> <b>(this version does not have Super Jokers yet)</b></p>
